        Canvas allows students to subscribe to a calendar feed with all your classes.
        When instructors make changes to the calendar, the feed is also updated.
        With the link to the feed, students can import the Canvas calendar into any calendar app like iCal or Google Calendar.
        The link to the feed can be found by going to:
      </p>
      <p class="code">
        Canvas >> Calendar >> Calendar Feed
      </p>
      <img src="Canvas Calendar Feed Screenshot.png" alt="Canvas Calendar Feed Screenshot" width="100%">
      <p>
        The problem with this feed is that all courses are combined into one calendar.
        This means that <i>courses cannot be color coded or separated</i> within whichever calendar app you use.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>There is a solution!</b> The Canvas API allows users to retrieve calendar feeds for each course independently.
        Students can subscribe to these course specific calendar feeds on a per-course basis, allowing color coding,
        separation of calendars by account, and categorization of schedules. There is no easy way built into the
        Canvas UI to get the links to these calendars so that's where this tool comes in. Rather than writing out a
        set of confusing instructions, I built this walkthrough to help other students find the links to those calendars
        without needing to really read too much into the details. Go to the <a href="walkthrough">walkthrough</a> to give it a try!
